## 4. Schema Compatibility Check

### 4.1 Integration with Existing Data
✅ Successfully integrated with existing InfraNodus data:

**Existing Nodes Preserved**:
- Brand (3 nodes)
- Product (13 nodes - 10 original + 3 new)
- Feature (14 nodes - 11 original + 3 new)
- Problem (9 nodes)
- Scenario (8 nodes - 5 original + 3 new)
- UserGroup (6 nodes)
- Context (5 nodes)
- Statement (5 nodes)
- Concept (9 nodes)
- User (1 node)

**Existing Relationships Preserved** (78 total):
- TO, BY, OF, AT connections maintained
- HAS_FEATURE, SOLVES, HAS_PRODUCT relationships intact

**No Data Loss**: All original InfraNodus nodes and relationships remain functional.

## 7. Known Limitations and Notes

### 7.1 Current Limitations
1. **Sample Data Only**: Only 44 GEO nodes created (production will have thousands)
2. **Manual Evidence Entry**: Evidence nodes require manual curation
3. **Static Gap Detection**: Gap nodes not yet auto-generated from InfraNodus

### 7.2 Future Enhancements
1. **Auto-Gap Detection**: Integrate with InfraNodus structure hole API
2. **Dynamic Scoring**: Real-time citation_ready_score updates
3. **Batch Import**: Bulk data ingestion from Reddit/Amazon/YouTube
4. **Version Control**: Add timestamp tracking to all nodes
